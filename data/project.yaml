    title: About our project
    description: >
      Our six-wheeled rover has a custom rocker-bogie suspension system with a low
      center of gravity designed for better stability and manoeuvrability. We have
      developed a robotic manipulator with 5 degrees of freedom and a task-specific
      end effector. Our rover features a robust autonomous system capable of path
      planning and traversal in highly uncertain terrains.
